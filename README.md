## ✅ Completed Projects

### 1️⃣ 🌡️ Temperature Prediction from Humidity

A regression-based project where a simple linear model is used to predict **temperature** based on **humidity**.

#### 📁 Dataset Description: `humidity.csv`

| Column       | Description                         |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| `humidity`   | Relative humidity (%)               |
| `temperature`| Temperature in Celsius              |
| `sensor_id`  | Sensor ID (not used in modeling)    |
| `lat`, `lon` | Sensor location coordinates         |
| `pressure`   | Atmospheric pressure (optional)     |

> ✅ Only `humidity` and `temperature` are used for modeling.

#### 🔍 Workflow:

- Load & clean the data  
- Drop missing values  
- Summary stats & correlation  
- Scatter plot (humidity vs temp)  
- Linear regression model  
- Evaluation & visualization  
- 🔚 Conclusion and next steps

### 2️⃣ 📈 Quantity Forecasting using Time Series Analysis

A time-series forecasting task using **ARIMA modeling** to predict quantity sold over time from transactional order data.

#### 📁 Dataset: `Raw Data_Predictive Analysis.xlsx`

| Column Name          | Description                     |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| `OrderDate`          | Date of the order               |
| `total_qty_sales`    | Total quantity sold             |
| `ParentProductNew`   | Product name                    |
| `ProductCategoryNew` | Category                        |
| `productListViews`   | Product views (optional)        |
| `productListClicks`  | Product clicks (optional)       |

#### 🔍 Workflow:

- Load and inspect timestamped data  
- Resample daily to weekly  
- Visualize sales trends  
- Time series decomposition  
- Train/test split  
- ARIMA model fitting  
- Forecasting + Evaluation  
- 📉 Actual vs Predicted plot
